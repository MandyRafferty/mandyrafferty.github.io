    <h2>Aim</h2>
     <ul>
      <li><p>Develop a mechatronic system that integrates sensors, actuators, and computation to solve an open-ended engineering problem.</p></li>
      <li><p>Create functional prototypes demonstrating subsystem performance and full system integration.</p></li>
      <li><p>Ensure portability, safety, and real-world applicability by addressing a customer need not currently met by existing products.</p></li>
      <li><p>Utilize CAD modeling, simulation, and microcontroller programming to optimize design and functionality.</p></li>
      <li><p>Complete project in a team of four people.</p></li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Approach</h2>
     <ul>
      <li><p>Translated customer needs from survey responses into product specifications to ensure final product meets performance, reliability, and safety expectations.</p></li>
      <li><p>Divided the project into subsystems and created a decision matrix to finalize the optimal design concepts to implement in our prototype.</p></li>
      <li><p>Assigned specific tasks to team members and establishing a structured workflow to ensure efficiency.</p></li>
      <li><p>Hosted team meetings three times a week to track progress, address challenges, and refine the design.</p></li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Result</h2>
     <ul>
      <li><p>Developed a semi-autonomous de-icing robot with remote-controlled operation through a Bluetooth-connected interface.</p></li>
      <li><p>â€‹Integrated multiple subsystems: salt solution tank, dual-pump spraying system, tracked locomotion for icy terrain, and sensors for bystander detection and tank monitoring.</p></li>
      <li><p>Achieved key design goals: portability, safety, low operating noise, and user convenience in winter conditions.</p></li>
      </ul>
