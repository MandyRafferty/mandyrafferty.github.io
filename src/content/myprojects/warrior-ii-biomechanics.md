    <h2>Aim</h2>
     <ul>
      <li><p>Analyze the forces acting on the knee during the Warrior II yoga pose.</p></li>
      <li><p>Investigate how common misalignments, such as excessive forward knee movement and torso leaning, affect these forces and increase the risk of knee injury.</p></li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Approach</h2>
     <ul>
      <li><p>Conducted a static equilibrium analysis using free body diagrams to calculate joint reaction forces and muscle forces at the knee.</p></li>
      <li><p>Varied knee flexion angles from 30°-180° and torso flexion angles to determine their effect on knee forces.</p></li>
      <li><p>Used MATLAB to plot muscle and reaction forces as a function of these angles.
      Compared the results for a 50th percentile man and woman using anthropometric data.</p></li>
     </ul>
    <h2>Result</h2>
     <ul>
      <li><p>Knee forces were minimized at a 90° knee flexion angle, confirming that maintaining proper form reduces stress on the knee.</p></li>
      <li><p>Highest knee forces occurred at a 105° knee flexion angle due to the inverse relationship between patellar tendon force and tibial shaft angle.</p></li>
      <li><p>Torso flexion increased forces at the knee, with maximum forces observed at 30° torso flexion.</p></li>
      <li><p>Findings reinforce the importance of correct form in Warrior II to prevent excessive stress and potential knee injuries.</p></li>    
      </ul>
