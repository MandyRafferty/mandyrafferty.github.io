    <h2>Aim</h2>
     <ul>
      <li><p>Develop a functional prototype of a medical cast incorporating granular jamming to enhance comfort, adaptability, and rigidity of traditional casts for individuals with wrist injuries.</p></li>
      <li><p>Evaluate the stiffness and comfort of the cast by measuring its Young’s modulus in both soft and rigid states through mechanical testing and user feedback.</p></li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Approach</h2>
     <ul>
      <li><p>Designed and fabricated a cast that incorporates a granular jamming layer consisting of coffee grounds enclosed in a latex membrane.</p></li>
      <li><p>Conducted three-point bend tests on jamming layer to evaluate applied force and extension, then calculate energy dissipation and Young’s modulus.</p></li>
      <li><p>Qualitatively validated the cast’s comfort in its soft state and its effectiveness in restricting wrist motion when rigid through user testing.</p></li>
    <h2>Result</h2>
     <ul>
      <li><p>Young’s modulus of the cast increased by approximately 47 times when in the rigid state compared to the soft state.</p></li>
      <li><p>Rigid state demonstrated significantly higher energy dissipation, suggesting improved impact resistance.</p></li>
      <li><p>User testing confirmed that the cast was comfortable in its soft state and successfully restricted wrist motion in its rigid state.</p></li>
      </ul>
