    <h2>Aim</h2>
     <ul>
      <li><p>Assess the current state of the well drilled in 2018 and evaluate its ability to meet community water demands.</p></li>
      <li><p>Collect data on water capacity, demand, and quality across five schools and a hospital in Kolunje, Kenya.</p></li>
      <li><p>Identify potential locations for a public water kiosk and a pipeline distribution system to improve water access.</p></li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Approach</h2>
     <ul>
      <li><p>Conducted site visits and stakeholder meetings with school leaders, hospital administrators, and community representatives.</p></li>
      <li><p>Performed water quality testing, including E. coli analysis, and measure pump performance to assess well functionality.</p></li>
      <li><p>Gathered data on student populations, water availability, and storage capacities at various schools and the hospital.</p></li>
      <li><p>Identified infrastructure issues, such as exposed wires and insufficient storage capacity, to determine necessary repairs and upgrades.</p></li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Result</h2>
     <ul>
      <li><p>Confirmed that the existing well provides water to the school but has limitations in storage and distribution capacity.</p></li>
      <li><p>Determined that water quality is generally acceptable, but periodic maintenance and testing are needed to ensure safety.</p></li>
      <li><p>Identified a critical need for a pipeline distribution system and a kiosk to improve water accessibility and reduce travel distances.</p></li>
      <li><p>Established plans for future implementation phases, including pipeline construction, additional well drilling, and improved storage solutions.</p></li>
      </ul>
